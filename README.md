# node-milight-io

This is a extention of node-milight-promise, to interface with the radio pcb within the milight bridge directly,
i.e., taking the bridge apart and ditching the WiFi part. For now it is just a hobby project, not working yet.

If you use the MiLight bridge without modification, you're better of with the original project:
